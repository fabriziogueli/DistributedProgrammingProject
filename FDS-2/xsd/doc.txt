The root element is FlightMonitor, the type of this element is FlightMonitorType.
The ComplexType FlightMonitorType may contains a sequence of elements: Aircraft (Type: AircraftType), Flight (Type: FlightType) and FlightInstance (Type: FlightInstanceType).

An AircraftType contains two elements: 
1) Seat : a sequence of string that represent the seats available on the aircraft.
2) Model : an ID Type attribute (required) that represent the model of the aircraft.

A FlightType contains four attributes:

1) DestinationAirport: an AirportType attribute (required) that represent the arrival airport code.
2) DepartureAirport : an AirportType attribute (required) that represent the departure airport code.
3) DepartureTime : a time attribute (required)
4) Number : a NumberType attribute (required) that represent the number of the flight.

The AirportType is a restriction of string type which constraints the string to be formed by three letters.

The NumberType is a restriction of ID type which constraints the ID type to be formed by two letters and at most four digits.

A FlightInstanceType contains a sequence of Passenger (Type: PassengerType) and six attributes:

1)DepartureGate : a String that represent the departure gate assigned to this flight instance.
2)Aircraft : an IDREF type that represent the Aircraft id which the flight instance refers to;
3)Flight : an IDREF type that represent the Flight id which the flight instance refers to;
4)Date : a Date type that represent the departure date for this flight instance.
5)Delay : an integer type that represent the delay of this flight instance.
6)Status : a StatusType element that represent the status of this flight instance.
