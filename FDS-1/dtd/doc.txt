The root element is FlightMonitor, it contains three sub elements: Aircrafts,Flights,FlightInstances.
These sub elements are only containers. I have used them to increase the comprehensibility of the xml file, but they are not necessary.

An Aircrafts element may contains zero or more Aircraft element.
An Aircraft element may contains one or more Seats element and must have one required attribute:
1)an ID type attribute "model" = The name of the model.

A Seats element is an empty element that must have one required attribute:
1)a CDATA type attribute "id_seat" = The seats available on the aircraft.

A Flights element may contains zero or more Flight element.
A Flight element is an empty element that must have four required attributes, an ID type and three CDATA type:
1)Number = the number of the flight.
2)DestinationAirport =  the arrival airport code.
3)DepartureAirport =  the departure airport code.
4)DepartureTime = the departure time.

A FlightInstances may contains zero or more FlightInstance element.
A FlightInstance element may contains zero or more Passenger element and must have six required attribute:

1) a CDATA type attribute "DepartureGate" = the departure gate assigned to this flight instance.
2) a CDATA type attribute "Delay" =  the delay of this flight instance. (if there is no Delay, it will be zero)
3) a CDATA type attribute "Date" =  the departure date for this flight instance.
4) an IDREF type attribute "Aircraft" = the Aircraft id which the flight instance refers to;
5) an IDREF type attribute "Flight" = the Flight id which the flight instance refers to;
6) an Enumeration type "Status" = the status of this flight instance.


A Passenger element is an empty element that must have three required attributes:
1) a CDATA type attribute "Name" = the passenger's name.
2) a CDATA type attribute "Seat" =  the seat assigned to the passenger.
3) an Enumeration type "boarded" = Tells if the passenger is already on-board.
